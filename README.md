# Microservices Project

This is a simple microservices project that consists of multiple services for creating and managing posts and comments. Each service is designed to be independent and communicates with each other through HTTP requests. The project includes both backend services (Node.js) and a frontend client (React).

## Project Structure

- `posts`: Microservice for creating and managing posts.
- `comments`: Microservice for adding and displaying comments on posts.
- `client`: Frontend client to interact with the microservices.
